# Speech-To-Speech System

A Speech-to-Speech system that utilizes Google Speech Recognition and Google Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies to convert spoken language into text, process it, and then convert the processed text back into speech.

## Overview

The Speech-to-Speech system works as follows:

1. **Speech Input**: The system receives spoken language input.
2. **Speech Recognition**: The input speech is converted into text using Google Speech Recognition.
3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The text is processed to understand and prepare it for speech output.
4. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: The processed text is converted back into speech using Google Text-to-Speech.
5. **Speech Output**: The final spoken output is produced.

## System Components

- **Google Speech Recognition**: Converts the input speech to text.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Processes the converted text for meaningful output.
- **Google Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Generates spoken words from the processed text.
- **Seamless Integration**: The system seamlessly integrates speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities.

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**:
   - The system uses Google's online Speech Recognition model to convert spoken language into text.
   
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - The converted text is processed to understand its context and meaning.

3. **Text to Speech (TTS)**:
   - The processed text is then converted into speech using Google TTS.

4. **Output Speech**:
   - The final output is the spoken form of the processed text, completing the speech-to-speech conversion.

## Requirements

- Google Cloud account with enabled Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs.
- Python (with `google-cloud-speech` and `google-cloud-texttospeech` libraries installed).
